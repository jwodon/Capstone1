Project Title: GameSphere

Proposal

1. Project Goal

GameSphere will serve as a comprehensive web application aimed at empowering video game enthusiasts to discover new titles, organize their playlists, and connect with a community of like-minded individuals.  The website will utilize the IGBD API to deliver detailed game information, personalized recommendations, and user-driven ratings.

2. Target Users

The primary target audience for GameSphere will be passionate video game players.  Specific demographics include:

Casual Gamers: Individuals who enjoy video games for recreation and entertainment.
Hardcore Gamers: Enthusiastic players seeking in-depth game information and community interaction.
Collectors: Users interested in building virtual libraries of their favorite games and retro titles.

3. API and Data Utilization

GameSphere will rely heavily on the IGBD API (https://api-docs.igdb.com/).  Primary data elements extracted from the API will include:

Game Metadata: Titles, release dates, developers, publishers, cover art.
Genres & Themes: Categorizing games for filtering and discovery.
Platforms: Available consoles and PC.
Ratings: Community-generated and aggregated scores.
User Reviews: Written reviews and feedback.

4. Project Development Framework

a.  Database Schema

A simple yet efficient relational database model is proposed:

User Table: username, email, hashed password, profile picture (optional).
Game Table (Linked to IGBD data): game ID, title, cover image, genres, platforms.
Ratings Table: user ID, game ID, rating (1-10 scale).
Lists Table: user ID, list name (e.g., Favorites, Played, To-Play).
List Entries Table: list ID, game ID.

b.  Potential API Issues and Solutions

Data Inconsistency: Regularly synchronize select portions of the database with the IGBD API to reflect game updates.
Data Accuracy: This is a community maintined database. May need to allow for community moderation (e.g. Wikipedia)

c.  Securing Sensitive Data

Strong password hashing and proper salting will protect user credentials.
User data handling will adhere to industry-standard privacy practices.

d.  Core Functionality

Game Search & Filtering: Powerful search based on title, genre, platform, etc.
Comprehensive Game Details: Information-rich game pages pulled from the IGBD API.
User Accounts: The ability to register and log in.
Rating System: Allow users to rate games.
Custom Lists: Capability to create personalized lists (Want to Play, Favorites, etc.).
Recommendations: Engine driven by user favorites and ratings.

e.  User Flow

Game Detail Page: Description, screenshots (API), release info, average rating, reviews.
User Profile: Edit profile, view rating history, manage lists.
Search/Filter: Results with title, cover, release date, platform.

f.  Beyond CRUD and Stretch Goals

Social Features: Discussion forums or a basic message system for players to connect.
Game News Integration: Pull relevant news articles from a gaming news API.
Personalized Dashboard: Highlight trending games based on user preferences.
Game discovery quizzes: A quiz to determine user prefs and reccomend games. 
Integration with streaming platforms: Display links to Twitch or other live stream platforms for specific game.
